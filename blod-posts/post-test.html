How to Use
If you aren't familiar with Jekyll yet, you should know that it is a static site generator. It will transform your plain text into static websites and blogs. No more databases, slow loading websites, risk of being hacked...just your content. And not only that, with Jekyll you get free hosting with GitHub Pages! This page itself is free hosted on Github with the help of Jekyll and Affiliates template that you're currently previewing. If you are a beginner we recommend you start with Jekyll's Docs. Now if you know how to use Jekyll, let's move on to using Affiliates template in Jekyll:

Using Affiliates template with Jekyll
git clone https://github.com/wowthemesnet/affiliates-jekyll-theme.git

cd affiliates-jekyll-theme

bundle

Edit _config.yml. If your site is in root: baseurl: '/'. Also, change your Google Analytics code, Disqus username, Authors, Mailchimp, ShareThis code etc.

jekyll serve --watch

Start blogging by adding your .md files in _posts.
